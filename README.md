Configure your deduplication algorithm in the window on the right. 
You configure the algorithm from different DeduplicateObject. DeduplicateObject look for groups of similar objects. These groups are combined into clusters through the sum or multiplication through the COmbination Score Method, and then filtered by the Confediancle Score.
